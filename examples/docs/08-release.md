# 8. Running the eight examples from the release image

> 中文版：[08-release_cn.md](08-release_cn.md)

This chapter runs the eight examples in §8.2 from the **published container image**:
the software stack is pinned and the aiter kernels are already compiled, so each
example is a single command with nothing to install. Chapters
[1](01-env-setup.md)–[4](04-launching.md) are the other path — building the
environment from source — which is what you need in order to swap models or run two
nodes (example 8, see [chapter 7](07-disaggregated-rdma.md)).

> ⚠️ **This image supports AMD gfx950 only** (Instinct MI350X / MI355X) and requires
> 8 cards. See §8.3.1.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhangDanyang-AMD/Lumen-RL.git && cd Lumen-RL
export DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data
docker pull zhangdanyangamd/lumen-rl:dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b
bash release/run_example.sh 1 --check
```

Four commands run the first example and verify the result automatically. To switch
examples, change the final digit.

The image supplies the environment; the checkout you just cloned supplies the code. The
launcher mounts it, so editing `lumenrl/` and running the same command again runs the
edit — no rebuild, no new tag. `LUMENRL_SRC=/other/checkout` runs code from elsewhere.

---

## 8.1 What is in the image

| | |
|---|---|
| Task | DAPO math RL (GRPO-style, per-uid group normalization) |
| Models | Qwen3-8B-Base (dense), Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base (MoE, 128 experts) |
| Training backends | Lumen FSDP2 (BF16 / FP8 blockwise2d), Megatron-Native (EP=8) |
| Rollout engines | vLLM 0.23.0 (BF16 / `fp8_per_block`), ATOM (BF16 / `per_block_fp8`) |
| Topology | 8 training actors + 8 co-located rollout replicas (TP=1) inside one Ray driver |
| Weight sync | ZMQ CUDA-IPC, same-device transfer, with coverage assertions |
| Hardware | **AMD gfx950 only (MI350X / MI355X), 8 cards** |

On the algorithm side: clip-higher + dual-clip + token-mean policy loss, dynamic
sampling (`filter_groups`), an overlong reward buffer, and TIS rollout correction.

All aiter kernels in the image are **already compiled** (25 objects), so the first run
spends no time compiling them:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash \
  zhangdanyangamd/lumen-rl:dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b \
  -lc 'ls /opt/lumenrl/aiter-jit/*.so | wc -l'     # 25
```

### 8.1.1 Pinned versions

Reproducing a result depends on the three upstream repositories below, which **cannot
be upgraded independently** and are therefore pinned by commit. Lumen-RL is **not pinned
by the image** — it is whatever your checkout holds, so **a result is identified by the
image digest *and* the Lumen-RL commit**. Every run prints both.

| Component | Repository | Branch | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lumen-RL | `ZhangDanyang-AMD/Lumen-RL` | `dev/dapo_release` | your checkout (mounted, not pinned) |
| Lumen | `ZhangDanyang-AMD/Lumen` | `amd-atom-rollout` | `e6379cbd9057` |
| aiter | `ZhangDanyang-AMD/aiter` | `lumen/moe` | `c395c62886e2` |
| ATOM | `ROCm/ATOM` | `main` | `0795f0eae2d6` |
| composable_kernel | aiter submodule | — | `af9e1d1f1ae3` |

ATOM is pinned on upstream `main`. `0795f0eae2d6` is the merge commit of
[ROCm/ATOM PR #2267](https://github.com/ROCm/ATOM/pull/2267) (2026-09-20), which also
carries the earlier [PR #2028](https://github.com/ROCm/ATOM/pull/2028). #2267 brings two
rollout fixes: a CUDA graph capture no longer writes cache through the rows of the last
served batch, and a wake rebuilds the KV pool at the size it slept at.

The aiter branch moved with it. The new ATOM imports `topk_select` from aiter at module
scope in `atom/model_ops/sampler.py`, and that symbol arrives with ROCm/aiter#5499 —
later than the old base of `lumen/moe`, on which the ATOM rollout cannot load at all.
`lumen/moe` is now rebased onto ROCm/aiter `main` `6a9a005b7`, with the Triton modules
Lumen needs restored where upstream has not re-landed them.

⚠️ **Swapping ATOM yourself needs two settings that Lumen-RL supplies rather than
inherit**:

- `compilation_config.cudagraph_mode=FULL` (engine kwarg, from `_pin_cudagraph_mode`).
  Without it a no-eager ATOM rollout aborts on the first CUDA graph replay.
- `ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON=1` (environment variable; `run_dapo.sh` defaults it to 1 for
  every `atom*` `MODE`, and `0` turns it off). ATOM's assembly paged-decode kernel
  returns **finite but wrong** output when a sequence's context occupies exactly 16 pages
  with a partial last one, so a handful of tokens per run come back with an arbitrary
  logprob. It **hides from `abs_diff`** — the number and average size of disagreeing
  tokens do not move — and shows only in the quadratic `chi2_token`: example 4 step 3
  measured 5761.69 against 0.0138 the step before, while `abs_diff` went 0.0370 → 0.0473.
  With the variable set, the highest `chi2_token` over three runs and nine steps of the
  same config is 5.39.
  ⚠️ **Do not expect it to improve `k3_kl`.** At a 4k response the defect fires rarely —
  once in those nine steps — and the reference is read at **step 1**, while example 4's
  event was at step 3, so this table's metrics structurally cannot see it. Judge whether
  the variable is working by `chi2_token`. ATOM's own fix is not in the pinned commit
  yet; drop this once it is.

Both are inert on ATOM builds that predate the corresponding field. What the failures
look like and why is in the comments of
[`release/versions.env`](../../release/versions.env).

Sleep is **not** pinned: it follows ATOM's own default, which releases the rollout's
weights, graphs and KV pool. Lumen-RL used to force `sleep_keeps_memory_resident=true`
here; that pin was removed on 2026-09-16 after the failure it guarded against stopped
reproducing. Releasing costs one graph recapture per step, about 1 s (2–3%), and does
not move the published metrics.

Base image `vllm/vllm-openai-rocm:v0.23.0`, plus `flydsl 0.3.2`,
`megatron-core 0.18.2`, ROCm Apex `daed8525`, ROCm TransformerEngine `6e541a10`.
The full list is in [`release/versions.env`](../../release/versions.env).

The container prints the HEAD of all four source trees at startup. To verify the
software stack:

```bash
docker exec lumenrl-release bash -lc 'python3 -c "
import aiter, lumen, lumenrl, vllm, flydsl, transformers
print(vllm.__version__, flydsl.__version__, transformers.__version__)
print(aiter.__file__)"'
```

Expect `0.23.0 0.3.2 5.12.0`, with `aiter` resolving under `/opt/lumenrl/aiter/`.

### 8.1.2 MORI-EP requires the Megatron ROCm fork

The image's `megatron-core` is NVIDIA upstream and has no MORI backend. The eight
examples do not need it — they all use the default `alltoall` dispatcher. For
`moe_token_dispatcher_type=flex` with `mori`, pin the fork instead:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 -b core_r0.18.0_rocm \
  https://github.com/ROCm/Megatron-LM.git "$DATA_ROOT/megatron-rocm"

MEGATRON_PATH=$DATA_ROOT/megatron-rocm bash release/run_example.sh 7 --check
```

`MEGATRON_PATH` is prepended to `PYTHONPATH`, so it must be visible inside the
container.

---

## 8.2 The eight examples

All eight run training *and* inference on the same 8 cards.

### 8.2.1 Overview

| # | Example | Training | Rollout | Command |
|---|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 8B BF16 baseline | FSDP2 BF16 | vLLM BF16 | `bash release/run_example.sh 1 --check` |
| 2 | 8B FP8 rollout | FSDP2 BF16 | vLLM `fp8_per_block` | `bash release/run_example.sh 2 --check` |
| 3 | 8B FP8 end-to-end | FSDP2 **FP8 blockwise2d** | vLLM `fp8_per_block` | `bash release/run_example.sh 3 --check` |
| 4 | 8B ATOM FP8 | FSDP2 **FP8 blockwise2d** | **ATOM** `per_block_fp8` | `bash release/run_example.sh 4 --check` |
| 5 | 8B ATOM BF16 | FSDP2 BF16 | **ATOM** BF16 | `bash release/run_example.sh 5 --check` |
| 6 | MoE FSDP2 | FSDP2 BF16 | vLLM BF16 | `bash release/run_example.sh 6 --check` |
| 7 | MoE Megatron EP=8 | **Megatron** TP=PP=CP=1, EP=8, DP=8 | vLLM BF16 | `bash release/run_example.sh 7 --check` |
| 9 | MoE ATOM BF16 | FSDP2 BF16 | **ATOM** BF16 | `bash release/run_example.sh 9 --check` |

**There is no example 8 here.** Example 8 in the
[examples README](../README.md) is the two-node disaggregated RDMA deployment, which
needs 2x8 gfx942 and is not covered by this image; see
[chapter 7](07-disaggregated-rdma.md). The numbering is shared across the whole
examples set, so this chapter runs 1–7 and 9.

- Examples 2 and 3 share one config and differ only in `TRAIN_FP8`: `0` quantizes the
  rollout only, `1` puts the training forward pass on FP8 as well.
- Example 5 is example 4's BF16 control: the same ATOM engine with the rollout online
  quantization and the training-side FP8 both switched off.
- Example 7 is example 6's Megatron twin: the two configs are field-for-field identical
  apart from `training_backend` and `megatron_cfg`, and EP=8 gives DP=8 to match FSDP2,
  so the two metric sets can be subtracted and the difference is the training backend.
- Example 9 is example 6's ATOM twin, and the pair answers "what does switching the
  rollout engine cost?": same model, same training config, `generation_backend` vllm
  → atom plus an `atom_cfg` block, nothing else. It is also the only example that
  exercises MoE expert weights over the ATOM weight-sync path — see §8.5.2 on why
  `skipped` is a health criterion.

### 8.2.2 Full parameters per example

This table *is* the launcher's internal table. When using the manual command (§8.4.5),
every column on the row has to be supplied.

| # | `MODE` | `TRAIN_FP8` | `CONFIG_OVERRIDE` (all under `examples/DAPO/configs/`) | `STEPS` | `max_response_length` | Model | Extra env |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bf16` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_vllm_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 512 | Qwen3-8B-Base | — |
| 2 | `fp8` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_vllm_fp8_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 512 | Qwen3-8B-Base | — |
| 3 | `fp8` | `1` | `dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_vllm_fp8_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 512 | Qwen3-8B-Base | — |
| 4 | `atomfp8` | `1` | `dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_atom_fp8_4k_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 4096 | Qwen3-8B-Base | `ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON=1` |
| 5 | `atombf16` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_atom_bf16_4k_smoke.yaml` | 1 | 4096 | Qwen3-8B-Base | `ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON=1` |
| 6 | `bf16` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3moe_a3b_ray_vllm_verlref_4k_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 4096 | Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base | `LUMENRL_FP32_MOE_ROUTER=0` |
| 7 | `bf16` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3moe_a3b_ray_megatron_verlref_4k_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 4096 | Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base | `LUMENRL_FP32_MOE_ROUTER=0` |
| 9 | `atombf16` | `0` | `dapo_qwen3moe_a3b_ray_atom_bf16_4k_smoke.yaml` | 3 | 4096 | Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base | `LUMENRL_FP32_MOE_ROUTER=0` `ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON=1` |

> ⚠️ **`MODE` and `CONFIG_OVERRIDE` must be given as a pair.** Besides selecting
> environment variables, `MODE` **appends a set of Hydra overrides**, and
> `CONFIG_OVERRIDE` only replaces the config file without cancelling them. The typical
> consequence of a mismatch: `MODE=atomfp8` unconditionally appends
> `compilation_config.level=3`, and combining that with a vLLM config yields
> `RuntimeError: aot_compile is not supported by the current configuration`.
> The launcher already pairs them correctly, so this is not a concern when using it.

All eight configs are `logger.wandb_enabled: false`, so **no wandb account is needed**
(see §8.4.6). `STEPS` is the command-line override for `num_training_steps`. None of
the eight smoke configs writes a checkpoint, so the examples can be run back to back in
any order.

## 8.3 Requirements

### 8.3.1 Hardware and drivers

- **8x AMD gfx950** (Instinct MI350X or MI355X), all cards idle
- Host ROCm 7.2, with `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` accessible
- Docker (if your user is not in the docker group, see the `DOCKER` variable in §8.4.4)

> ⚠️ **This image only runs on gfx950.** TransformerEngine and Apex are compiled with
> `NVTE_ROCM_ARCH=gfx950` / `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx950`, and the 25 aiter kernels
> compiled into the image were built on gfx950. Those JIT artifacts do not carry an
> architecture tag in their filenames, so on gfx942 (MI300X / MI308X / MI325X) they are
> loaded as-is and fail at runtime instead of being rebuilt. For gfx942, build
> separately: `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx942 bash release/build_image.sh`.

### 8.3.2 Disk

| Item | Measured |
|---|---|
| Image download size (compressed layers, summed from the registry manifest) | **11.8 GB** |
| Cold pull | **85 s** |
| Image unpacked on disk | **47.3 GB** |

The 85 s cold pull is **network-bound** (about 139 MB/s here) and does not transfer to
another machine; the portable number is the 11.8 GB download size.

**Recommended budget**: 60 GB for the image (47.3 GB unpacked plus 11.8 GB of
compressed layers retained in the content store) plus 74 GB of models and data, so
about **134 GB**. All eight examples are smokes and write no checkpoints. A long run
(`--longrun`) needs checkpoint space on top — a single 30B-A3B FSDP2 checkpoint
(fp32 weights plus optimizer) is about 342 GB, and `save_total_limit` decides how many
are kept.

### 8.3.3 Models and data

The following must exist under `$DATA_ROOT`. This is exactly the list the launcher
preflights:

| Path (relative to `$DATA_ROOT`) | Size | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| `models/Qwen3-8B-Base/` | 16 GB | examples 1–5, plus the tokenizer for all of them |
| `models/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base/` | 57 GB | examples 6, 7, 9 |
| `data_cached/qwen3-8b-maxprompt1024/dapo-math-17k.filtered.parquet` | 1.02 GB | all (train) |
| `data_cached/qwen3-8b-maxprompt1024/aime-2024.filtered.parquet` | 892 KB | all (val) |
| `logs/` | — | created by the launcher |

To prepare them from scratch, see §8.4.3.

---

## 8.4 Usage

### 8.4.1 Confirm the cards are idle before starting

```bash
docker ps -a                                    # is someone else's container holding cards
rocm-smi --showmeminfo vram | grep -i used      # works directly on the host
```

All eight cards should sit at the **idle baseline of about 298 MB**
(297766912–297832448 B measured on MI355X). Anything above that means a co-tenant or an
orphan process from a previous run. The launcher makes this a hard gate: it refuses to
start if any card is above 2 GB and prints what to do about it; `--force` skips the gate.

### 8.4.2 Get the image

```bash
docker pull zhangdanyangamd/lumen-rl:dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b
```

You can also build it yourself; these are all the steps:

```bash
git clone -b <branch> <lumen-rl-repo> && cd Lumen-RL
bash release/build_image.sh                  # 45-60 min, mostly TransformerEngine
TAG=lumenrl:release-$(date +%Y%m%d) bash release/precompile_kernels.sh
```

`precompile_kernels.sh` needs a GPU: aiter kernels are only compiled on first use and
`docker build` has no devices, so they have to be compiled in a container with cards
attached and committed into the image. That script's synthetic warmup covers 5 of the
25 kernels; see its header for how to cover all 25.

### 8.4.3 Prepare the data

```bash
export DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data
```

Check against the list in §8.3.3. Downloading from scratch takes two steps, both inside
the container (start it as in §8.4.4 first):

```bash
# 1) models and raw datasets
docker exec -e DATA_ROOT="$DATA_ROOT" lumenrl-release bash -lc '
python3 - <<PY
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
import os; D = os.environ["DATA_ROOT"]
snapshot_download("Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base", local_dir=f"{D}/models/Qwen3-8B-Base",
                  allow_patterns=["*.json","*.txt","*.safetensors","*.model","tokenizer*"])
snapshot_download("BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k", repo_type="dataset",
                  local_dir=f"{D}/raw/DAPO-Math-17k")
snapshot_download("BytedTsinghua-SIA/AIME-2024", repo_type="dataset",
                  local_dir=f"{D}/raw/AIME-2024")
PY'

# extra for examples 6, 7 and 9 (about 57 GB)
docker exec -e DATA_ROOT="$DATA_ROOT" lumenrl-release bash -lc '
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base \
  --local-dir "$DATA_ROOT/models/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base" --max-workers 8'
```

```bash
# 2) filter out prompts longer than 1024 tokens, producing the two parquet files in §8.3.3
docker exec -e DATA_ROOT="$DATA_ROOT" lumenrl-release bash -lc '
python3 - <<PY
import os, glob, datasets
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
D = os.environ["DATA_ROOT"]; MAXLEN = 1024
OUT = f"{D}/data_cached/qwen3-8b-maxprompt1024"
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(f"{D}/models/Qwen3-8B-Base")
def first(g): return sorted(glob.glob(g, recursive=True))[0]
jobs = [(first(f"{D}/raw/DAPO-Math-17k/**/*.parquet"), f"{OUT}/dapo-math-17k.filtered.parquet"),
        (first(f"{D}/raw/AIME-2024/**/*.parquet"),     f"{OUT}/aime-2024.filtered.parquet")]
os.makedirs(OUT, exist_ok=True)
nproc = max(1, min(64, (os.cpu_count() or 8) // 4))
for src, dst in jobs:
    ds = datasets.Dataset.from_parquet(src); n0 = len(ds)
    ds = ds.filter(lambda d: len(tok.apply_chat_template(d["prompt"], add_generation_prompt=True,
                                                        tokenize=True)) <= MAXLEN, num_proc=nproc)
    ds.to_parquet(dst); print(src, "->", dst, n0, "->", len(ds))
PY'
```

> The data only has to be filtered once and is shared by all eight examples: the two
> models have identical `tokenizer.json` / `vocab.json` / `merges.txt` (vocab 151936),
> so a filter computed with the 8B tokenizer is valid for the MoE model too.
>
> **The MoE model must be the Base variant.** The instruct / thinking Qwen3-30B-A3B does
> not close `</think>` within `max_response_length`, so every sample is truncated,
> reward is stuck at -1, `filter_groups` comes up empty for 10 rounds, and the run
> raises `RuntimeError: filter_groups collected no valid groups`.
>
> For ModelScope mirrors (same repo IDs, same local paths) see
> [`03-data.md`](03-data.md).

### 8.4.4 The launcher

`release/run_example.sh` is a host-side script. It checks that the cards are idle,
manages the container, assembles every environment variable, writes predictable log
paths, and after the run compares each metric against built-in reference values.

The launcher and this chapter are versioned together, so **use the copy in the host-side
`release/` directory**. The image ships one too, but it is fixed at the commit the image
was built from and its built-in references may predate the table in this chapter.

```bash
bash release/run_example.sh <1..7> [options]
bash release/run_example.sh --help
```

The launcher creates and reuses the container, named `lumenrl-release` by default; if
it already exists the launcher runs `docker restart` first, because after a finished run
each card may still hold about 90.9 GB (see §8.5.2). The equivalent manual form:

```bash
docker run -d --name lumenrl-release \
  --network=host --ipc=host \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add=video \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --shm-size 64G \
  -v "$DATA_ROOT":"$DATA_ROOT" -e DATA_ROOT="$DATA_ROOT" \
  -v "$PWD":/opt/lumenrl/Lumen-RL \
  zhangdanyangamd/lumen-rl:dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b sleep infinity
```

The second mount is the code, with `$PWD` being the root of this checkout. Leave it out
and the container runs the copy baked into the image instead, which is a different commit
as soon as you change anything.

Log paths are fixed:

```
$DATA_ROOT/logs/example-<N>-<timestamp>.log           # trainer log
$DATA_ROOT/logs/example-<N>-<timestamp>.launcher.log  # wrapper output and exit code
```

| Option / variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--check` | after the run, compare metrics and report PASS / FAIL |
| `--check-only --log PATH` | do not run, only validate an existing log |
| `--steps N` | override the number of training steps |
| `--longrun` | use the example's longrun config instead (see §8.4.6) |
| `--detach` | start and return immediately, for long runs; prints how to check liveness |
| `--dry-run` | only print the commands that would be issued |
| `--force` | auto-remediate busy cards or leftover containers instead of failing |
| `--no-restart` | do not restart the container (to reuse compile caches) |
| `--keep-cache` | do not clear compile caches between examples 4 and 5 (see §8.5.2) |
| `--verbose` | print the full log in the foreground rather than the highlights |
| `DATA_ROOT` | **required**, host data directory |
| `IMAGE` / `CONTAINER` | image tag / container name |
| `DOCKER` | e.g. `DOCKER="sudo docker"` |
| `EXTRA_OVERRIDE` | extra Hydra overrides, space separated |
| `WANDB_API_KEY` | only needed with `--longrun` |
| `STALL_LIMIT` | seconds of log silence before declaring a hang, default 2400 |
| `MEGATRON_PATH` | Megatron source tree to import ahead of the image's `megatron-core`; needed for MORI-EP (§8.1.2) |

Running your own Lumen-RL needs nothing extra — that is the default. To run it from a
*different* checkout than the one holding the launcher:

```bash
LUMENRL_SRC=/other/Lumen-RL bash release/run_example.sh <N>
```

The other three trees are editable installs too, so the same mount works for them:

```bash
docker run -d --name lumenrl-dev ... \
  -v "$PWD/ATOM":/opt/lumenrl/ATOM \
  zhangdanyangamd/lumen-rl:dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b sleep infinity
```

then `CONTAINER=lumenrl-dev bash release/run_example.sh <N>`. Unlike Lumen-RL, those
three are what the reference values are pinned to, so a result from a swapped ATOM,
Lumen or aiter is no longer comparable with §8.5.1.

### 8.4.5 The manual command, without the launcher

Below is the complete command for example 1. For the other examples, replace `MODE`,
`TRAIN_FP8`, `CONFIG_OVERRIDE`, `STEPS` and `MODEL_PATH` per the table in §8.2.2, then
add the environment variables in that table's last column (`-e
LUMENRL_FP32_MOE_ROUTER=0` for examples 6, 7 and 9, `-e ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON=1` for
examples 4, 5 and 9).
`bash release/run_example.sh <N> --dry-run` prints this command for any example.

```bash
export DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data

docker exec \
  -e RL_ROOT=/opt/lumenrl \
  -e DATA_ROOT=$DATA_ROOT \
  -e SCRATCH_ROOT=$DATA_ROOT \
  -e PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF= \
  -e MODE=bf16 \
  -e TRAIN_FP8=0 \
  -e STEPS=3 \
  -e CONFIG_OVERRIDE=examples/DAPO/configs/dapo_qwen3_8b_ray_vllm_smoke.yaml \
  -e MODEL_PATH=$DATA_ROOT/models/Qwen3-8B-Base \
  -e LOG=$DATA_ROOT/logs/example-1.log \
  lumenrl-release bash -lc 'bash /opt/lumenrl/Lumen-RL/examples/DAPO/run_dapo.sh'
```

The log does not go to stdout; `run_dapo.sh` writes straight to `$LOG`. Follow it with
`tail -f "$LOG"` and extract metrics with
`grep -o 'step=[0-9]* .*rollout_corr/kl=[^ ]*' "$LOG"`.
Run `docker restart lumenrl-release` between examples, and also clear the compile caches
between examples 4 and 5 (§8.5.2).

Four things that are easy to miss:

- `CONFIG_OVERRIDE` is **relative to `$RL_ROOT/Lumen-RL`**; an absolute path is not found.
- Without `CONFIG_OVERRIDE`, `MODE` selects the **longrun** config
  (`wandb_enabled: true`, `max_response_length: 20480`), not the smoke one.
- `MODEL_PATH` defaults to the 8B model, so examples 6, 7 and 9 silently run the wrong
  model if it is not given.
- The empty value after `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=` is not a typo: only an explicitly
  empty string turns off `expandable_segments`.

### 8.4.6 wandb

| | smoke configs (the eight in §8.2.2) | longrun configs (`--longrun`) |
|---|---|---|
| `logger.wandb_enabled` | `false` | `true` |
| Account needed | **no** | yes, `WANDB_API_KEY` |
| `max_response_length` | 512 / 4096 | 20480 (4096 for example 7) |

So the eight examples in §8.2 need no wandb account. Only `--longrun` uses it:

```bash
WANDB_API_KEY=xxxx bash release/run_example.sh 1 --longrun --detach

# without an account, switch it off; the launcher adds this itself when it sees no key
EXTRA_OVERRIDE=logger.wandb_enabled=false bash release/run_example.sh 1 --longrun --detach
```

> The Hydra key is `logger.wandb_enabled`, not a top-level `wandb_enabled`; getting it
> wrong yields `ConfigKeyError: Key 'wandb_enabled' not in 'LumenRLConfig'`.
> A missing key fails *after* `RLTrainer.setup ... complete`, so the first few minutes
> look entirely normal.

## 8.5 Verifying the result

`--check` performs the judgement described in this section: it extracts the four step-1
metrics and compares them against the built-in reference values, counts occurrences of
`Traceback` / `OutOfMemory` / `CUDA error` / `HSA_STATUS`, counts weight-sync buckets
that skipped a tensor, and reports PASS or FAIL. For reading the numbers yourself, see
below.

```bash
bash release/run_example.sh 1 --check
bash release/run_example.sh 1 --check-only --log $DATA_ROOT/logs/example-1-xxx.log
```

### 8.5.1 Reference values

**Measurement conditions**: 8x MI355X (gfx950), image
`dapo-gfx950-rocm7.2.3-260921b` (digest `sha256:eede1d8fcdf5…`) with Lumen-RL at
`22502fa` — both matter, see §8.1.1 — the command being
`bash release/run_example.sh <N>` (equivalent to a full row of §8.2.2),
**`seed=10086`** (fixed inside `run_dapo.sh`), and metrics read at **step 1**
(`step=1`).

The two bold columns with tolerances are what `--check` turns into PASS / FAIL; each
reference is the mean over the number of runs in the `runs` column.

⚠️ **The whole table was re-measured on this image on 2026-09-21**, three runs per
example and five for example 4, where most rows previously had one. Every `k3_kl` moved
by between **−8.9% and +10.5%** against the reference it replaces — the new ATOM, the
rebased aiter and this round's changes did not measurably alter train/rollout alignment.
The point of re-measuring was the spread, not the values.

**The spread is what the extra runs bought.** The worst deviation of any run from its
own example's mean ranges from 2.0% (example 2) to 32.1% (example 4). Tolerances are
unchanged, and all 26 runs pass against this table.

⚠️ **Example 4 is the widest of them; do not tighten its tolerance to a single
observation.** Its five runs are 0.00271 / 0.00339 / 0.00426 / 0.00460 / 0.00499, a
factor of 1.8. Its reference before this round was 0.00287, and three runs mid-round sat
high enough to look like a systematic shift from `ATOM_FORCE_ATTN_TRITON` (§8.1.1); the
fifth run came back at 0.00271, which makes it spread rather than shift.

**The span column carries no tolerance and is not part of the verdict** — it is
dominated by how warm the caches are and has been measured up to ±15% apart on the same
machine. The launcher's end-to-end wall clock is 20–35 s longer.

**Result on this image: 26 runs over the eight examples, exit code 0 throughout**, all
four error counts **zero**, every weight-sync bucket at `skipped=0`, `--check` **26/26
PASS**, with every run's `k3_kl` within **±32.1%** of its example's reference — example
4 being the widest, as above. The per-run record is in
[`VALIDATION.md`](../../release/VALIDATION.md).

**Example 9 versus example 6 — what the rollout engine costs.** Same model, same
training config, ATOM instead of vLLM: `k3_kl` is 0.00138 against 0.00158, well inside
tolerance, so **switching the rollout engine does not move train/rollout alignment
measurably.** What it moves is time: 56.7 s per step against 106.7 s, about 1.9x faster,
paid for with 409 s of setup instead of 203 s. So a 3-step smoke reports ATOM as slower
end to end (579 s against 523 s) while the per-step figure is what matters for a real
run. Example 7 pairs the same vLLM rollout with a Megatron actor and lands at 103.0 s.

### 8.5.2 Criteria

- **`rollout_corr/k3_kl` is the primary criterion** — ±30% for the 512 group
  (examples 1/2/3), ±50% for the 4096 group (examples 4–7 and 9). It is non-negative and
  far steadier than `entropy`, so it is the metric to judge a reproduction on.
- **`entropy` is the secondary criterion** — ±25% for the 512 group, ±50% for the 4096
  group, ±60% for the three MoE examples (6, 7 and 9). It is a mean over the batch that
  survives `filter_groups`, so its variance is high, especially on MoE. **Judge MoE on
  `k3_kl`.**
- **`rollout_corr/kl` is only an order-of-magnitude criterion.** It is a signed mean, so
  only the absolute value is checked, against a band from one tenth to ten times the
  reference. **One order of magnitude above is what counts as wrong**, and the usual
  cause is model-sensitive RMSNorm not being enabled on one side.
- **`rollout_corr/ppl_ratio` is informational** and not part of the verdict.
- **Every weight-sync bucket must report `skipped=0`.** The four error counts cannot
  stand in for this one: a rollout that silently fails to update some of its weights
  exits 0, logs every step and raises nothing, so it reads as a slow accuracy regression
  rather than a fault.

  ```bash
  grep -oE 'bucket done - updated=[0-9]+, skipped=[0-9]+' <log> | sort | uniq -c
  ```

  A healthy run is `skipped=0` on every line. Examples 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 use the vLLM
  path and print no such line at all, which also counts as clean.

> When the numbers do not match, **first confirm you ran the same config**:
> `grep -m1 'CONFIG=' $DATA_ROOT/logs/example-<N>-*.launcher.log`
> prints the config, `MODE`, `TRAIN_FP8` and `STEPS` actually used. A config mismatch
> and a numerical regression look identical in the metrics, but the former is far more
> common.

## 8.6 Problem handling

**1. VRAM is not released when a run finishes.** After a smoke ends normally each card
may still hold about 90.9 GB: the Ray workers have exited but the memory has not been
returned to the driver. Restart the container between runs, otherwise the next run gets a
smaller KV cache budget. The launcher does this before every run.

```bash
docker restart lumenrl-release
```

**2. Switching ATOM precision *or model* requires clearing the compile caches.** The
torch inductor cache is not isolated per run, so going from example 4 straight to
example 5 (or back) fails in AOTAutograd. The launcher records the previous ATOM
precision and clears only when it changed (`--keep-cache` disables this).

```bash
docker exec lumenrl-release bash -lc \
  'rm -rf /tmp/aiter_configs /tmp/atom_torch_compile_cache /tmp/torchinductor_root'
```

⚠️ **The model collides too, not just the precision.** ATOM keys the cache by
`mode/actor_id/replica/rank` and nothing else, so examples 5 and 9 — both `atombf16`,
different models — share one cache directory. Running 9 after 5 replays the 8B graph
against the 30B MoE and dies during engine init with
`assert_size_stride ... stride 2048==4096` (the two hidden sizes). It reads like a
corrupt engine rather than a stale cache. **Driving the examples yourself, clear the
caches between every pair that differs in precision or model.**

**3. Judge a long run's liveness from the log, not with `pgrep`.** Processes started via
`docker exec` do not share a process tree with your shell, so `pgrep` returns 0 across
sessions. **Watch whether the log file is still growing:**

```bash
watch -n 30 'ls -l $DATA_ROOT/logs/example-4-xxx.log'
```

**4. `docker restart` terminates a `--detach`ed run.** Before restarting, the launcher
checks whether the previous log is still growing; if it is, it refuses to start and says
what to do. `--force` means terminate it anyway.

**5. `waiting for baton release` in the log is not a hang.** The 8 training actors are
queued behind one of them finishing a JIT compile. It should not appear with this image,
where every kernel is precompiled, but can if you mount your own aiter source.

**6. `filter_groups round N` does not appear for every example.** Only configs with
dynamic sampling enabled emit it, and **examples 2 and 3 have it switched off** — at
`max_response_length: 512` a base model rarely finishes a problem, so dynamic sampling
would filter out every group. Both still complete all 3 steps and pass `--check`.

**7. When overriding the `aiter` source, change `AITER_JIT_DIR` too.** Compiled kernels
are bound to the aiter revision that produced them, and reusing the old directory fails
at import time with a message that mentions neither aiter nor the branch:

```
AttributeError: module 'aiter.jit.module_aiter_core' has no attribute 'MlaVersion'
```

Add `-e AITER_JIT_DIR=/tmp/aiter-jit-<your-branch>`.

**8. `flydsl` must be upgraded together with `aiter`.** The base image ships 0.1.4.2
while `aiter/lumen/moe` requires `>= 0.2.4` (this image pins 0.3.2). A mismatch shows up
as the import-time error below, raised from ATOM's `model_ops/moe.py` with no mention of
aiter at all:

```
ImportError: Unsupported `flydsl` version: expected >=`0.2.4`, got `0.1.8`.
```

**9. FP8 training divergence** (very low entropy, `grad_norm` and `rollout_corr/kl` both
around 1e4): see [6. Troubleshooting](06-troubleshooting.md).

**10. A negative KV pool on the wake after a weight sync** means the ATOM rollout is
releasing its memory on sleep instead of keeping it resident. It only bites the MoE
example, and only after step 0 has already succeeded:

```
ATOM/atom/rollout/memory_manager.py:137  resume_memory
AssertionError: Not enough memory for KV cache with block size(16). At least 1 block
  (1.50MB) is required, but available_for_kv=-30805.98MB (budget=86.40GB,
   peak_torch=57.68GB, non_torch=52.88GB, safety=5.76GB, free=177.39GB)
```

`non_torch` is the rest of the node, mostly the colocated trainer, and `free=177.39GB` is
the tell: the memory exists, it is just not credited to the rollout engine. Raising
`gpu_memory_utilization` does not fix it and neither does freeing the actors' allocator
cache — item 1 above is why.

⚠️ **This stopped reproducing on 2026-09-16** and the pin it motivated is gone; sleep
releases by default. It is kept here because the margin was thin — the pool came out at
−1435 MB against an 86 GB budget — so a bigger model could bring it back. If it does,
`atom_cfg.engine_kwargs.sleep_keeps_memory_resident=true` still keeps the pool resident.
