"""Fused-MoE weight sync between a transformers-5.x trainer and vLLM.

transformers 5.x stores Qwen3-MoE experts as fused 3D tensors, so the training
side's ``state_dict()`` -- which is exactly what the IPC weight sync sends --
emits::

    model.layers.N.mlp.experts.gate_up_proj    (E, 2*I, H)
    model.layers.N.mlp.experts.down_proj       (E, H, I)

vLLM calls the same buffers ``experts.w13_weight`` / ``experts.w2_weight`` and
its ``expert_params_mapping`` only recognises the *per-expert* checkpoint names
``experts.{id}.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight``. A fused name therefore matches no
mapping and falls through ``Qwen3MoeForCausalLM.load_weights``'s silent
``if is_expert_weight: continue`` branch: no exception, no loaded param, and
93% of the policy's parameters never reach the rollout engine.

vLLM >=0.22 adds a wrinkle: the expert buffers moved into a nested
``RoutedExperts`` submodule, so their path gains a ``routed_experts`` segment
while the trainer keeps sending the shorter HF name. See ``_CONTAINER_SEGMENTS``.

This module closes that gap on the receiving side. ``FusedMoEWeightRouter``
intercepts the fused tensors and feeds them to vLLM's own
``FusedMoE.weight_loader`` through its 3D "full load" path (one call per
shard instead of 128), so TP sharding, hidden-dim padding and any load-time
kernel-format handling stay vLLM's business. The layouts are element-wise
identical -- verified against Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base by loading the same checkpoint
through HF and through vLLM and comparing ``gate_up_proj`` with ``w13_weight``
bit for bit on layers 0/1/23/47.

``assert_weight_sync_coverage`` is the second half: the original bug survived 54
training steps only because ``load_weights()``'s return value was discarded, so
every sync now has to account for every parameter in the rollout model.

    train/rollout divergence, not a crash. Comparing the loaded set against
    ``named_parameters`` turns that into an immediate error.

    directly comparable to ``named_parameters`` pass ``default_mode="warn"``.
