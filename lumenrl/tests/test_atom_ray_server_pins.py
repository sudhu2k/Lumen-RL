"""The engine kwargs ATOMRayServer supplies rather than inherit from ATOM.

There is one left, `_pin_cudagraph_mode`, and it applies exactly when
torch.compile is on -- never for an eager rollout, where no graphs are captured
and the value would do nothing.

`_pin_sleep_keeps_memory_resident` used to sit beside it, forcing a no-eager
rollout to keep its weights and KV pool allocated across sleep. It was removed
once ATOM's own default (release) was measured to work: see
`test_no_sleep_pin_is_supplied`.
